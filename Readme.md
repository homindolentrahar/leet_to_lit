# Leet to Lit ðŸ”¥

> *From Leet to Lit, we shall not quit!*

*A journey of a modest developer to become a better one*

## Background

I used to be a developer that never laid an eye to DSA-thingy. With my naive mind, I thought that I could be "just-fine"
because I'm just handling the front-end side (Well, mobile actually). I went to Uni and sure this subject crossed, but I
was firmly believed that this just some kind of "rite of passage" for every developer; just some yadda-yadda to make CS
students looks cooler talking to each other in machine dialect. Besides that, my brain is not wired properly and the
whole semester-worth DSA course just flew over my head.

After graduated, I have nothing to do besides looking for a job. I eventually got a company's attention, and they sent
me a test. Sure I thought, "Imma ace this test, I'm applying for a mobile developer position anyway, there wouldn't be
any DSA shenanigans, what could go possibly wrong right?". WRONG, a big frikkin' WRONG. Although the test was just 2
questions, it turns to be a nightmare. I think it has something to do with knapsack and some other stuff that I never
figured out.

From that moment, I realized that I'm not just a mobile developer, I'm a developer. My primary job is to solve problems,
not just to change button color and complaining about API response to back-end. I need to learn DSA ***IMMEDIATELY***,
so I can finally secure a job and claim my title as a `DEVELOPER`. So here I am, trying to learn DSA and share my
journey with you (not exactly, I just want to track my
journey here). Enjoy the ride, and let's get lit together! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

## Languages

I'm not a polyglot, but I'm trying to be one. Here are some languages that I've been using:

- Kotlin
- Dart
- Go
- Other languages soon ðŸš§

## Why'd I do this?

- Track my progress in learning DSA
- Share my dumb ways of solving problems
- Redemption for my negligence of DSA in the past

## What'll you find here?

- A note file describing the problem and my solid goldfish analysis of it
- Step-by-step solutions of the problems (from the worst to the better)
